############Image Viewer#############################
WebGl Javascript Library
####USAGE######
You should be able to upload an image as a texture and then use the corresponding x,y and angle inputs to 
translate it by the x and y values, rotate it through the angle, scale it through the x and y, or 
shear the image through the x and y inputs by clicking each action after entering inputs

#######Known Issues#############
Does not actually perform these actions. Attempted to implement matrices that could act as the modifiers for each affine transformation
But when implementing them it crashes the code and I can not figure out what part of it is syntacctically incorrect in the WebGl Library.
